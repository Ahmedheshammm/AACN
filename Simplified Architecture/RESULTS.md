## ðŸ“Š Performance Summary
---
Our experiments highlight the enhanced capabilities of the **Attention-Augmented ResNet-18 (AA-ResNet-18)** when compared to a standard ResNet-18 baseline. As shown in the table below, AA-ResNet-18 consistently achieved superior performance metrics.

| Model        | Final Test Accuracy | Params (M) | Best Train Acc. |
| :----------- | :------------------: | :--------: | :-------------: |
| ResNet-18    |       ~87.40%       |   ~11.2M   |     ~97.53%     |
| AA-ResNet-18 |       ~89.25%       |   ~13.1M   |     ~99.58%     |

The AA-ResNet not only achieved a higher final test accuracy but also demonstrated better **per-class consistency and generalization**, indicating its effectiveness in learning more robust features.
